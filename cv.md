## Hi i'm Andrew
 >I am 20 years old. I study in BNTU on the 3rd course at the Faculty of Information Technology and Robotics. My specialty is “automation of technological processes and production”. In the process of learning I studied C ++ and Python. Now I really want to learn and work with the web part. There is a goal and therefore there is a reason to study and work.
